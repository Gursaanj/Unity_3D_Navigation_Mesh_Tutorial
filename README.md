# Unity_3D_Navigation_Mesh_Tutorial


In this project I use UNITY 3D to learn about and play around with Navigation Meshes.

Things like baking, varying cost areas and different forms of navigation mesh agents and navigation mesh obstacles. As well as generating off mesh links (both automated and manual).

I also toyed around with the addition Navigation mesh packages on Unity's Github. In which Navigation meshes and can be pre baked and baked in real time. allowing certain methods to be called so that new meshes and surface area costs can be made in real time.

This repository will mainly be used to play around with different ideas and toy with the packages.
